- In 'calendar.txt', 'monday', 'tuesday', etc. are defined as 'enum' (values 0 and 1) in the GTFS specification but our implementation is considering an unsigned integer (different of 0 is true, 0 is false) which means we accept values like 2, 3, 42 which are not conform to the specification
- In 'stops.txt', 'stop_lat' and 'stop_lon' are conditionaly required but our implementation will crash if not present (see PR of patochetp for a fix)
- The specification of how to parse 'shapes.txt' doesn't exist... but the implementation seems to exist! It can't be a pass-through strategy since 'shapes.txt' doesn't exist in NTFS
- The specification of how to parse 'frequencies.txt' doesn't exist... but the implementation seems to exist! It can't be a pass-through strategy since the field `exact_times` doesn't exist in NTFS
- The specification of how to parse 'calendar.txt' and 'calendar_dates.txt doesn't exist... but the implementation seems to exist!
- In the specification, I can specify if the converter will panic or not for different cases, but part of the error's analysis was also about logging. It feels like logging shouldn't be detailed in the specification.
- At first, I thought every ID that was not specified was making the system panic (at least for the required ones). But it is not true, since they're all technically implemented as String, if they are empty, the system will not panic with empty ID. It might panic if there is 2 with an empty ID though (collision of IDs).
- The implementation is parsing the field `local_zone_id` in `stop_times.txt` of GTFS... but this field doesn't exist in the specification! Short discussion with David and Virginia: it might be one of the GTFS producers (Fusio, client?) which produce this field and we don't want to loose it and since NTFS support this field, the conversion to NTFS would keep it.
- The specification mentions about dataset and contributor but do not give any indication about what are the needed input information.
- The conversion of `location_type` between GTFS and NTFS is not specified. For now, we log a WARN message (something like "This location type is not supported") if the input value is 2, 3 or 4 (see PR of patochetp for an improvement on that topic)
